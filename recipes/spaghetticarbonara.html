        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Today we'll show you how to make spaghetti carbonara better than any restaurant, so you can master this dish with some tricks to make it perfect.</p>
        <p>Authentic carbonara is a humble recipe made with very few ingredients to season spaghetti. It really only calls for guanciale (cured pork jowl),
             pecorino cheese, and fresh eggs. With just these ingredients, you can make this delicious pasta sauce,
              seasoned with a few turns of freshly ground black pepper and a sprinkle of grated cheese on top.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>100g of Pancetta (Preferably Guanciale)</li>
            <li>50g of pecorino cheese</li>
            <li>Ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>320g of Spaghetti</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the pancetta into small pieces and fry those pieces until they begin to brown.</li>

            <li>Beat the 3 egg yolks with the whole egg and freshly grated pecorino cheese <strong>until you have a slightly thick mixture</strong>.
                 Add a few grinds of black pepper to the mixture.</li> 

            <li>Put the pasta to cook in plenty of salted water, and take it out when there are a couple of minutes left before it is al dente.</li>

            <li>In the pan where we had reserved the sautéed pancetta or guanciale, we will add the drained pasta to which we add the mixture of eggs, cheese,
                 and pepper, mixing well. We also add a ladleful of the <strong>pasta cooking water</strong>.</li>

            <li>Stir while the different ingredients combine and a sort of sauce forms as the egg lightly sets in the hot cooking broth.
                 Serve sprinkled with a little more grated pecorino and a couple more turns of freshly ground pepper.</li>
        </ol>
